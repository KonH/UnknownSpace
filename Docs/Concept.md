# Concept

**Unknown Space** is a set of mini-games wrapped up in meta gameplay in a sci-fi space setting.  
In **meta gameplay**, players can move between planets, complete quests, trade with other players, and improve inventory.  
The inventory improvement process is a merge - players can combine several boosters of level N to create a level (N + 1) booster.

In **linear gameplay** players can participate in several types of survival gameplay:
- **Defence** - enemies attacks from above, active booster - push enemies
- **Attack** - player should avoid bullets and fly as far as possible, active booster - speed up
- **Survival** - enemies attacks from all directions, active booster - kill enemies

All types of gameplay also contain passive booster - increase damage.  
A player can activate an active booster while playing and can enable a passive booster before the level started.  
Each quest (planet + type combination) has its leaderboard, and players can beat others' scores.  
Rewards are generated randomly and have 3 quality tears based on score rewards containing resources and boosters.
